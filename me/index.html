        <h3>Judy is a sophomore at Hunter College majoring in Emerging Media and minoring in Computer Science. She is an artist but her true passion lies in UI/UX design and front-end development.</h3>
        <p>She loves cats as much as she loves to read, ask anyone she knows her most quoted phrase is <q>In my next life, I hope to become a famous instagram cat.</q> 
        Although her parents forbid her to own anything other than a fake plant, others fear that this would only cause her to spiral more into becoming a <q>crazy cat lady</q> in the future.       
        Her close friends and relatives have since hidden away any beloved pet in fear that they might someday encounter the Judy's invincible secret weapon, catnip. 
        On her free time when she is not searching for stray cats to feed, she reads. <q>What does she read?</q> Yes.
